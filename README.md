# Project Name
> Lending Club Case Study


Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing loan default risks for Lending Club, an online platform that facilitates personal, business, and medical loans. The primary objective is to identify patterns and factors that predict loan defaults using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). By understanding these factors, Lending Club can refine its risk assessment and lending strategies, thereby minimizing financial losses and improving overall loan performance.
